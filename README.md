This project will contain all code for the development of a ChatBot that
will generate language in a conversation framework, based on distilgpt2,
which is supposed to be able to run in an iPhone 7. It will be trained
with Whatsapp conversations to test the capability of the system to generate
logic answers. Later on it would have to be adapted to the specific domain,
therefore it can serve as a chatbot for many different social networks. This
can be useful for the automatic management of enterprise and professional
accounts.
